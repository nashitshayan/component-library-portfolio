        <h2 class="blog-subheading">short lived enthusiasms</h2>
        <p>For the most part, my journey through life has been a battle against inconsistency. Be it in academics, deen, or in my personal life, I’ve always struggled at being consistent at something. Over the course of my teenage years, I’ve jumped from one thing to another, never quite sticking to something for a long time.</p>
        <p>There are two exceptions to this : reading books and playing basketball. These two things I’ve been able to carry on doing ever since I first started, albeit with periods of stagnancy. As for most other things, my enthusiasm was short-lived. I can’t exactly pinpoint the reasons for this, but I suspect that I never gave enough time to engross myself in something as I did to these two. Another reason could be the environment I grew up in, which did not appreciate exploration and extracurricular activities. The sole focus was always put on academics and anything else was duly sidelined. Now the question may arise that how, in fact, was I able to cultivate a reading habit and become decent at basketball? For the former, I had to resort to hiding the fact from my family (READ: ebooks under blankets). As for the latter, I used to squeeze some time out to play before, during, and right after school.</p>
        <p>This pattern of behaviour continued into my late teens and well into my college life. I was never quite able to form lasting good habits. Changing directions with every semester, soon enough my college life had come to an end with me still being a wreck in many ways. Imagine being stuck in a loop of trying to climb a staircase and falling back down after a few steps. That’s how my life was.</p>
        <p>Being away from Islam had played a huge role. In fact it was the main reason for me being miserable throughout my life. Despite being brought up in a muslim household, I was quite ignorant about Islam , barely practicing the obligations. All praise is for Allah, my situation changed last year. The lockdown during the pandemic was a blessing in disguise for me. Allah The Most Merciful guided me in Ramadan and I was inspired to change from my lowly state. But the journey ahead was going to be full of stumbles and tumbles.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-subheading">get up, walk, fall, repeat</h2>
        <p>
            After some initial progress, I found myself struggling again. Changing a lifetime of behaviour patterns wasn’t going to be easy, I messed up quite a lot. I’d follow a routine for a few days then get lazy again. I’d start a course, but leave it in the middle. I’d follow a diet and exercise plan for a month, but a week off would slap me down to the same level again. I was getting tired of this.
        </p>

        <h2 class="blog-subheading">moments of clarity</h2>
        <p>While struggling with maintaining a consistent routine and making small progress, I experienced what I’d call ‘moments of clarity’. These were short periods when I was doing well and was able to stay focused enough to actually make some visible progress. This positive growth gave me a boost of confidence in my ability to climb out of my misery and I tasted the feeling of contentment, even if it was short lived. Henceforth, despite falling short again, I didn’t feel as miserable and hopeless as before. Now, I had something to believe in. Something that showed me that if I put in the effort, then God Willing, I’d be able to do so much more than I gave myself credit for.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-subheading">a firm resolve</h2>
        <p>As months passed, the periods of positive growth increased while the frequency of pitfalls lessened, becoming weaker each time. Now they didn’t hurt as much, and with each setback, the determination to rise again grew stronger. This is where I am right now. I can’t say I’ve managed to stay consistent all the time, but my determination has grown. My mindset is much more positive and I’m making visible progress towards my goals. For the time being, that’s all that matters. Instead of focusing on the outcome, I now focus on the process, and that makes all the difference.
        </p>
        <p> Alhamdulillahi rabbil aalameen.</p>
