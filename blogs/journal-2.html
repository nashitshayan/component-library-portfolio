        <h2 class="blog-subheading">my first CLI app</h2>

        <p>The first lesson of levelZero of neogCamp was an introductory one. We learned how to work with CLI (Command Line Interface), with our instructor Tanay Pratap walking us through the basics of programming. Even though I’m not new to programming, this lecture was very beneficial because it focussed on laying down a firm foundation, something I realised I lacked.
        </p>

        <p>The exercises were constructed in a way to make us think and recall the basic concepts that we’ve learned. Finally, we had to combine the different concepts and use them all together to make a simple “DO YOU KNOW me?” quiz.
        </p>

        <h2 class="blog-subheading">MCU trivia</h2>
      
        <p>For the assignment we had to use the same concepts and build another quiz app on any topic of our choosing. I chose to make a quiz on MCU. There were several bonus point functionalities that we could add to the quiz app. It was fun to figure out the challenge and to come up with the solutions.
        </p>

        <p>I learned how to use the readLineSync and CHALK libraries. This was the first time that I read the document and tested out the different functions by running the code. It was a fun experience.
        </p>


        <h2 class="blog-subheading">final thoughts</h2>

        <p>Overall, I probably learned and implemented more in this one lesson than I did in any other programming class I’d ever taken.</p>

       
        <p>I’m grateful to Tanay Pratap and TeamTanay for their dedication and effort that they’ve put in this camp.
        </p>

        <p> Alhamdulillah, who guided me to this.
        </p>
